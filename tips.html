    <h1>Tips And Advice!</h1>
    <h2> Tips</h2>
    <p> Sydney has a range variety of activities to do, some that cost money, and some that don't. 
        It's best to travel to free activities around the harbour and city areas.

    <h2> Advice</h2>
    <p> Sydney is a central bub for many tourists, there are lots, and lots, and LOTS of people. Don't worry! And don't be overwhelmed! 
        <br>Here's some advice for you: </br>
        <br><strong>1. There is Absolutely No Need to Overpack </strong></br>
        Sydneysiders prefer to keep their clothing casual during the day. Like casual dresses, stylish shirts and cloth jackets.
        It does get cold though, so it's best to pack something light or warm, unless there's a cold blast, but don't worry, just pack a little something extra warm.</br>
        <br> <strong> 2. Book the Dining and Accomadation in Advance</strong></br>
        Much of what you will do in Sydney will depend on the weather, so too much preplanning can come to last minute itinerary changes anyway.
        However, if there are specific destination resturants you <em> really</em> need to go to, book ahead, especially on the weekends.
        The best value for accomadation will be on the Australian summer months like Janurary and Feburary, or when major events are on. This makes hotels and resturants fill up quick.
        So if you're planning to come to Sydney in the summer month time, make sure to prebook, avoiding the rush and expensive costs. </br>
        <br> <strong>3. Swim Sensibly and Don't Take Risks!</strong></br>
        Sydney's beaches are pretty and beautiful, but the shark attacks that have occured are a lot, and tend to lead to death and life-changing injuries. 
        Even though it's rare you should still be careful while swimming like:
        <br> 1. Not going into any body of water alone</br>
        <br> 2. Not entering <em> any type of current</em></br>
        <br> 3. Sticking with huge crowds </br>
        <br> 4. Always swimming between the <strong> red and yellow flags</strong>. This signifies that the lifeguards are on duty and have chosen the safest area on the beach.</br>
        And, in case you're stung by a jellyfish, rinse with water or vinegar. (The first aid is usually avaliable at the surf lifesaving club)
